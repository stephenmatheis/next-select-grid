I'm in love. I first heard about this genre after reading Travis Baldree's cozy fantasy novel [Legends & Lattes](https://www.travisbaldree.com/books). I picked it up a few months ago on whim because the cover was adorable and the promise of a low stakes story about a former adventure opening a coffe shop is exactly the type of low stakes story I prefer. My main source is slice of life isekais. But even those can pull at the heartstrings like only anime can.

I had no idea this literay style even existed. I wanted to find similar storie. A quick search brough me to [r/CozyFantasy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyFantasy/).
